  <h3>Organizational information on writing a Bachelor thesis</h3>
  
  The supervisor allocation process is centralized and done by the examination office. If (and only if) you have been assigned Alexander Klos as your supervisor, the following rules apply:

  <ul>
	<li> The starting date will be determined through mutual consultation and agreement. It has to be within the pre-announced writing time period set by the examination office.</li>
	<li> The Bachelor thesis can be written either in English or in German.</li>
        <li> The topic will be determined by me after a short appointment. During this appointment, students will be asked about their general topic preferences (for example Finance or Decision Analysis).</li>
        <li> I will not allocate topics that lie outside of my research interests or teaching focus.</li>
        <li> Each student receives a short description of the topic (typically not more than three sentences) on the starting date and not earlier.</li>
  </ul>
