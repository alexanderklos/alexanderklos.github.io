  <h3>Organizational information on writing a Bachelor thesis</h3>
  
  The supervisor allocation process is centralized and done by the examination office. If (and only if) you have been assigned Alexander Klos as your supervisor, the following rules apply:

  <ul>
	<li> We will determine the starting date through mutual consultation and agreement. It must be within the pre-announced writing time period the examination office sets.</li>
	<li> You can write your Bachelor thesis in English or German.</li>
        <li> I will determine the topic after a short appointment. During this appointment, students will be asked about their general topic preferences (for example, Finance or Decision Analysis).</li>
        <li> I will only allocate topics within my research interests and/or teaching focus.</li>
        <li> Each student receives a short description of the topic (typically not more than three sentences) on the starting date and not earlier.</li>
  </ul>
